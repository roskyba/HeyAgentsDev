example review: Matthew was professional, honest and kept me updated from day one
  to the end of the campaign. He achieved a price more than we anticipated. I particularly
  appreciated his honesty and his down to earth approach to things. I strongly recommend
  Matthew to anyone looking for an agent to sell their property.
