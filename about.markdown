  header: About us
  text: Selling is one of life’s most overwhelming events, often causing stress and
    uncertainty. We created Hey Agents with the mission to simplify the agent selection
    process with the smartest, most sophisticated experience - ever.
company description: "The right agent representing you can be the difference between
  tens of thousands of dollars - so selecting an agent to sell your biggest asset
  is a critical choice. We believe the traditional process is stressful and convoluted,
  with a lack of information and resources, sellers are bound to a decision based
  price and intuition alone - that can be a very expensive mistake. Research tells
  us that the fear of being harassed, lack of efficiency and transparency are limiting
  a seller’s best interests. \n\nAt Hey Agents we believe in a dramatically simplified
  process, and that everyone should be empowered by data, transparency and choice.
  That’s why we built a platform that cuts through the noise, providing the most comprehensive,
  unbiased and transparent view of your local agents. Hey Agents allows you to determine
  exactly who the most qualified agent is for your property, making the decision based
  on gut instinct now a thing of the past."
value propositions:
- header: Transparency
  text: As an independent third party, we verify all of the people on our platform
    and all of the information they submit. Beyond that, we do not cull our data.
    We strive for a platform with unbiased accuracy, protecting both sellers and agents
    from fabricated or cherry-picked facts.

- header: Control
  text: Our anonymous platform empowers sellers to connect with agents on their own
    terms and to research and compare with more data from more agents. Agents also
    have the control to position themselves across an array of metrics – not just
    commission rates or total sales.

- header: Efficiency
  text: 'Hey Agents streamlines the process of finding an agent by skipping the phone
    calls and letter-box drops, and instead, getting right to what sellers and agents
    are really after: information tailored to their property, and vetted leads of
    ready sellers.'
