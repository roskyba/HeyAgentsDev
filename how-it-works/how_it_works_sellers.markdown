  header: How Hey Agents makes money
  text: Hey Agents exists to support sellers as they navigate the complex process
    of finding an agent. In doing so, we also make it easier for agents to find active
    sellers in the market, which means we pass on our fees to agents only. Sellers
    don't pay anything, ever.
  points:
  - header: Commission rates
    text: When referral fees are high, this cost tends to get passed on to the seller
      via higher commission rates. We charge agents only 5% +GST of their commission
      on completed sales, which is significantly less than the "industry standard"
      of 20%.

  - header: Your data
    text: Your personal data is safe with us – we will never sell or pass on any sensitive
      data, such as contact information.

  - header: Ratings and proposals
    text: We want you to make educated decisions based on unbiased information, so
      agents cannot pay to alter or remove reviews or sales data, or to appear higher
      in your list of proposals.
